Consider a network topology with 10 nodes. Write the following modules for:

-         Node initialisation

-         Creating distance matrix

-         Detecting neighbours

-         Building link cost packets

-         Updating routing tables

-         Tracing the shortest path from source to destination.

Using the modules mentioned above, implement the following routing algorithms: (the algorithms should be distributed in nature)

1.     Bellman-ford algorithm

3.     Link state algorithm

 

Reviews:

1.     Compare the end-to-end delay for all the algorithms considering the same pair of source and destination.

2.     Justify your result.
